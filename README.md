# Ellipitcal Curve Digital Signature Authentication Overview

This project demonstrates how to you ECDSA algorithms to sign and verify data.  Although not directly related to ECDSA, it shows how to create a Public Address using the same approach as Ethereum and other block chain technologies.  ECDSA, and this type of cryptogrphy is an essential component of blockchain technology.  

I also demonstrate how to store the public and private keys in a string format.  This can be tricky because the cryptography algorithms work with byte arrays.  However, byte arrays are difficult to debug and work with when storing data.
